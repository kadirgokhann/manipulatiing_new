# Object Constructor Example in C++

This repository demonstrates a simple example of manually calling a constructor using **placement `new`** in C++. The code allocates memory for an `Object` and explicitly calls its constructor. Additionally, it showcases the generated assembly code for various parts of the program, compiled on macOS.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: Contains the core C++ code that illustrates memory allocation using `operator new` and calling a constructor explicitly with placement `new`.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Explicit Constructor Call Using Placement New

In C++, when memory is manually allocated using `operator new`, the constructor for the object is not called automatically. To invoke the constructor, **placement new** is used, which allows constructing the object at a pre-allocated memory address.

void explicit_constructor_call(Object* ptr) {
    new (ptr) Object();  // Placement new to call the constructor explicitly
}

### 2. Memory Management
The code demonstrates how to:

Allocate memory manually using operator new.
Cast the allocated memory to an object type.
Explicitly call the constructor of the object.
cpp
### Copy code
void* memory = operator new(sizeof(Object));  // Allocate memory block
Object* ptr  = static_cast<Object*>(memory);  // Cast memory block to object type
explicit_constructor_call(ptr);               // Explicit constructor call using placement new
## 3. Assembly Code
The generated assembly code shows how the constructor and memory management operations are translated into low-level machine instructions, providing insights into how these operations are handled at the hardware level.

Usage
To compile and run the code, use the following commands:

g++ -std=c++11 -o object_constructor main.cpp
./object_constructor
This will output the data value of the Object class, which is set to 10 in the constructor.
